## 📞 If It Still Doesn't Work

If you still get an error, it means there's something specific about your environment or file that I cannot detect through automated testing.

**In that case, I recommend:**
1. Switch to Code Repository Mode for your next session
2. Upload your entire project
3. I'll be able to see the exact issue and fix it directly
