## Project Structure
Summary
I've broken down the original monolithic application into a modular structure with clear separation of concerns:

Configuration Management: Handles loading, saving, and managing application configuration
Database Management: Handles database operations for storing and retrieving data
Business Logic: Contains core business logic for chemical calculations and analysis
UI Components: Manages the user interface and user interactions
Reporting: Handles report generation and formatting
Utilities: Provides utility functions used throughout the application
This modular approach offers several benefits:

Maintainability: Each module has a single responsibility, making it easier to maintain and update
Testability: Modules can be tested independently
Reusability: Components can be reused in other applications
Scalability: New features can be added without modifying existing code
Readability: Code is organized logically, making it easier to understand
The application follows good software engineering practices:

Separation of Concerns: Each module has a specific responsibility
Dependency Injection: Components receive their dependencies rather than creating them
Error Handling: Comprehensive error handling throughout the application
Logging: Detailed logging for debugging and troubleshooting
Configuration Management: Centralized configuration management
Input Validation: Validation of user input to prevent errors
This modular structure provides a solid foundation for future enhancements and maintenance.
